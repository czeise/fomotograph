# Fomotograph

The Fomotograph project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s [The MVC Pattern in Ruby](https://www.udacity.com/course/the-mvc-pattern-in-ruby--ud270) class.

For this project I took the [provided "spaghetti code"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) and re-implemented and improved upon it using the [Sinatra framework](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern.

## Running the web app
To run this application locally, clone this repo and then install the necessary Ruby gems:
```
bundle install
```
When the appropriate gems are installed, you'll be able to run the app in a local server:
```
ruby app.rb
```
